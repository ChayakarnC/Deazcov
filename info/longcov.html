    <h1>Long - Covid</h1>
    <p>Most patients' symptoms improve within a few days or weeks. They are usually completely cured within 12 weeks,
      but some patients may have long-term health effects known as “Long COVID,” or the US Centers for Disease Control
      and Prevention calls symptoms that persist after being infected. 4 weeks of “Post-COVID Conditions.”

        <p>Long COVID is a syndrome that can last for weeks or months after contracting the virus.
          The symptoms found are quite diverse, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Tiredness, fatigue </li>
          <li>Memory loss/ADHD</li>

        <h4>Complications of COVID-19
        </h4>
        <p>COVID-19 can have a number of systemic complications as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Thromboembolic events (approximately 15% of patients need to be hospitalized which is very high compared
            to the side effects of some vaccines)
          </li>
          <li>Cardiovascular system
          </li>
          <li>Acute renal failure
          </li>
          <li>Acute hepatitis
          </li>
          <li>Neurological/psychological complications
          </li>
          <li>Sepsis</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS), which is caused by an immune response, causes inflammation of
          various systems or “autoimmunity,'' where patients will have fever, diarrhea, kidney failure, and shock after
          getting infected with COVID-19 and is recovered for about 2-4 weeks. Currently, there is not enough evidence
          suggesting how many months that complications will persist.

        <h4>Side effects from COVID-19 treatments
        </h4>
        <p>Some symptoms may be similar to the side effects of long hospital stays with other illnesses. COVID-19
          patients with severe symptoms often require treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU). After the critical
          stage, 'Post-intensive Care Syndrome' (PICS) develops, such as
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Muscle weakness
          </li>
          <li>Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (takes time to recover)

        <p>Post-COVID must be diagnosed separately from other severe diseases or other causes. You should consult a
          doctor at the hospital who will check your history/record, measure blood pressure/pulse, take a blood test or
          x-ray of the lungs. This condition usually improves over time, so each hospital should set up a
          multidisciplinary team to monitor the patient's condition after leaving the hospital. Most importantly, the
          best way to prevent post-COVID is to prevent contracting COVID-19.
